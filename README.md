## What is Movieo?

This is a place for browsing and watching movies, made with love by a few developers. We adore movies but finding where to watch was usually a hassle. We had been searching for a nicely designed and simple interface for watching movies without the use of torrents, yet we couldn’t find one… so we made one ourselves. Movieo started out as a passion project and continues to improve thanks to wonderful people like yourself who give us invaluable feedback on a daily basis.
